# WD000013: PC running slow Troubleshooting Steps
Updated by **Tyler Smith** on **09-20-2023**

- Run a Dell Command Update
- Make sure to plug in charger while updates are going
- If there is a lot, you may get user's contact information and contact them when it's done and ready for pick up
- You can also show the user how to do it and they can do the process themselves on their own time since this is an essential thing to do at least once a month
- Sometimes there are drivers update that shows as a link on the bottom of the other updates and you would run that to if needed.
- Run the regular updates first and after machine restarts, go back into Dell Command Update and run those drivers that are linked at the bottom
- If Dell Command doesn't work, there could be another issue to solve.
