Updated by **Tyler Smith** on **09-20-2023**

**MANAGERS CANNOT PICK UP A COMPUTER FOR A USER, THE USER NEEDS TO PICK IT UP THEMSELVES.**

New Hire's usually come in on **Monday's**

Pick up for machine's is on the **1st floor of green in the HR room on the right hand side past the staircase.** *(idk what the room is actually called)*

- From TechZone, you go up the middle staircase and it's on the right hand side hallway.

New Hire Coordinator (Lawrence, Morris) will have everything set prior to pick up date, provided that the equipment and accounts were requested in accordance with lead time policy.

- There are certain machine's that will be put in the back of TechZone to be deployed, New Hire Coordinator will communicate that to TechZone.
- We advise for the New User **not to change their PW** until they have attended their New Hire Orientation which happens on **Tuesday's.**
