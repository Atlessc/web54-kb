# WD000031: Loaner Device Set Up
Updated by **Tyler Smith on 01/16/2024**

- Make sure user has **EVERYTHING** backed up on previous machine on their OneDrive
- Have user sign into computer
- Applications to sign into/set up
    - Outlook
    - Microsoft edge
    - OneDrive
- Sometimes Teams isn't on loaner or needs to be updated
    - If needed, Install teams through office app on web
    - If needed, Install latest update
- Make sure their network drive is available
    - Sometimes it's not there and you can check it in the files
    - See sections "Basic Troubleshooting" or "Terminal Scripts (PC)" for how to put Network Drive back
- **DO NOT INSTALL** ANY OTHER "SPECIAL" SOFTWARE it's a LOANER NOT THEIR ACTUAL OWNED MACHINE.
    - If they request a software to be installed and it is for work please ask permission from TechZone Managers first just to make sure (Michael or Alexis)
- Once everything is good to go you may deploy loaner to user
    - Ask if they need a charger because sometimes they may already have a compatible charger.
