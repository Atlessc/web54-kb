Updated by **Tyler Smith** on **09-20-2023**

# This is an isssue that can be caused by several origins. We will go over over the least invasive to the most invasive troubleshooting steps to take

- Empty the Recycling Bin
- Delete old downloads
- Move everything from the users main folders like desktop, downloads, documents, ect to onedrive.
- Check the User profiles also on the laptop
	1. Click the winKey
	2. Search "View Advanced System Settings"
	3. In the "user profiles", click settings
	4. Select the users and delete them one by one
		- Anything over 2gb will take a few minutes
- If you cant delete the user, do these next steps
	1. Open command prompt as admin
	2. Type "query user"
		- You should see your session and the other user's current session that you will need to stop
	3. Take a note of the other's ID number in the ID column (it should be a single digit number)
	4. Type "logoff [ID]" but replace the [ID] with the ID number next to the user you want to sign out
- Clear the OS index cache
	1. Press the WinKey
	2. Type "index options" and launch it
	3. Click "Advanced" and type in your HLP account creds
	4. Click "Rebuild"
	5. This will take a long time so tell the user they need to keep the computer on and running but can still use 90% of apps except for file explorer using the search function
- If all else fails, you will need to do a factory reset
