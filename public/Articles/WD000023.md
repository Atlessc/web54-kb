- [Mobile Device Intake Log (smartsheet.com)](https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form/cdde5516c6434a9c9151a13fac6135b0)
- GRAB ALL INFORMATION FROM USER BEFORE THEY LEAVE TechZone
    - Name
    - Phone Number
        - if the user is not in the system add “555-555-5555”
    - Adidas email address
    - SN/IMEI of phone
    - reason for drop-off

TIP #1: if the phone is wiped and you only have the name, you can see if the user is still in Service Now (ASPEN).

- open a draft incident ticket (don’t create the ticket, we are only using the “customer” field)
- if their name is in the system, add the user to the customer field
- click on the “i” next to the field
- click “open record”
- scroll all the way down in the user’s record
- look for the cluster of tabs with names like “assets”, “incidents”, and “computers”
- click on the “mobile Phones” tab
- look at the entry(ies) and find the one that is closest to the phone handed in and use that data
- you have SN, phone number, and IMEI info here

IF THE NAME ISN’T THERE MOVE ON TO TIP#2

TIP #2: if HR or the user’s line manager is dropping the phone, mostly like the user is no longer in the system
