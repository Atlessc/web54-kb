Updated by **Tyler Smith** on **09-20-2023**

- Changing Passwords/Relinking Passwords to get into locked computer
    - Use your `Remote Desktop Connection`
- Then type: `usporamad01` and click `Connect`
- Go to the Active Directory and Seach Up user's name
- It should be under `Find` and make sure it is on the `am.adsint.biz` network
    - Once you have the user pulled up, right click to Reset/Change PW
    - Make sure all boxes are **NOT CHECKED**
    - It works best if user changes PW to **`PassTemp465`** format for successful change
    - If it is just a relink, then their own standing password should be okay.
    - Last, have user test the new password on their machine by logging back in
