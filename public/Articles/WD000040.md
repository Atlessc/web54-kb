1. Go into WORLD OF APPS
2. Search Nam_Secure --> Reinstall --> Once that is done go to next step
3. Search HP Printer ---> Click Reinstall – HP Printer Essentials SE 
4. Start Printing! 
5. Make sure to select NAM_Secure when you are printing and NOT "follow you"

## First Time Printing on HP Printers:
1. Scan Badge
2. Login Manually with the same credentials you would use to log into your computer Press Print All 
3. When finished, DON'T FORGET TO LOG OUT. 

### After your first print, you will only need to scan badge and not have to log in manually. 

- If an error occurs and says you need a specific driver to print, use this link to install printer manually, [Click Here](https://ftp.hp.com/pub/softlib/software12/HP_Quick_Start/osx/Applications/HP_Easy_Admin.app.zip)
